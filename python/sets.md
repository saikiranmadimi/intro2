# Sets
A set in python borrows from the conventional set in mathematics. It can only store unique values. In other words, you can never have duplicates in a set.

## Tasks
Using documentation and the python shell, find the answers to the following questions. **you actually don't really need the internet**
1. How can you make a set?
2. How do you add to a set?
3. How do you remove a set?
4. Can you index into a set? If so, how?
5. How do you iterate through a set?
6. Can you find the length of a set? If so, how?
7. How do you check to see if something is present in a set?
8. Can you sort a set? If so, how?
