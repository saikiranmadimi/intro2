## A Look Ahead
1. Multiple Choice Quiz (Friday June 1st)
2. Final Exam (Friday June 8th) - You will be given a reference sheet 
3. Final Project (Monday June 11th)

## Final Project Start
Look for some interesting Data Sets that are formatted in a way you think you can use:
https://www.sajari.com/public-data
https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/#datasetscategory
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=CSV
http://statweb.stanford.edu/~sabatti/data.html

You can work together with classmates to find datasets.

#### Research
**DUE By Monday:**
Have a partner. Hand in a 1-2 paragraph proposal for your website. Explain what data you have access to and what you plan to do with it.

#### Plan
**DUE by Wednesday:**
Have a prototype of your website. Include several views of the data, and what you want the user to be able to do (More on this later)

#### Guidelines
Final Project (Data Project) Requirements:
Part I - Choose either A or B
a)Take 2 different data sets and use python to find and display some relationship.
    (Differences, clustering, correlations, etc)
b)Take a large data set that has a lot of parts to it, and find some trends/differences/correlations when viewing subsets of the data.
    (e.g. different age groups, geographic locations, or other factors)

Part II: (we haven't learned this yet)
Use interactive forms to allow the viewer of the website to select what they would like to see from the data set.

Work with a partner on the project. Look at your partner's websites before you commit to a partner!
